# How many cells are added to the simulation at once, per time step? Type 0 if all at once. Ex. 5
group: 0

# At what step is doxycycline added, allowing cells to become GATA6 high?  This activates the finite dynamical system
# pathway in the simulated cells used to quantify the FGF/ERK pathway. Ex. 49
dox_step: 49

# Use the Guye movement method? This mode will have GATA6 high cells move toward differentiated cells simulating
# the movement seen in Guye et al. Ex. True
guye_move: True

# What is the threshold for designating a cell lonely and increasing the death counter? If the cell has less neighbors
# than this value the death counter will be increased by one. Ex. 3
lonely_thresh: 2

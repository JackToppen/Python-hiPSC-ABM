How many cells are added to the simulation at once, per time step? Type 0 if all at once. Ex. 5
| 0 |

Use the Guye movement method? This mode will have GATA6 high cells move toward differentiated cells simulating
the movement seen in Guye et al. Ex. True
| True |

What is the threshold for designating a cell lonely and increasing the death counter? If the cell has less neighbors
than this value the death counter will be increased by one. Ex. 3
| 2 |
